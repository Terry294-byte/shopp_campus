# Admin Dashboard Fixes

## Issues to Fix:
1. **Duplicate Add Product buttons**: Remove the "Add Product" tab since FloatingActionButton already provides this functionality
2. **Overflow issues**: Fix responsive design issues in statistics cards and header
3. **Tab structure**: Update to more logical structure (Overview, Users, Products)

## Changes to Make:
- [ ] Update TabBar to remove "Add Product" tab (change from 3 to 2 tabs)
- [ ] Update TabController length from 3 to 2
- [ ] Update TabBarView children to match new tab structure
- [ ] Fix statistics cards overflow by making them responsive
- [ ] Fix header overflow issues
- [ ] Update tab content structure

## Files to Edit:
- lib/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart
